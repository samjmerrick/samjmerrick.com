summary: "Participating in my first game jam: what I learned and what I'd do differently"
---

Just over a week ago, I took part in the [GMTK Game Jam 2025](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2025). Itâ€™s the largest annual game jam by number of entrants, and also happened to be my first.

This yearâ€™s theme was **Loop**: a wonderfully open-ended theme that left plenty of room for interpretation and creativity.

After a few false starts on the GMTK team finder, I was lucky enough to find a great team at the last minute who were looking for a music composer and SFX artist. Together, we made [**The Circle of Life**](https://superbloom.itch.io/the-circle-of-life).

Here are a few things I learned throughout the process:

---

## 1. Musical comfort zone

If I were to label my musical style, it would fall somewhere between _ambient_, _cinematic_, and _soundscape_, with a bit of _melodic_ and _emotive_ thrown in for good measure. Lovely for my own artistic expression, not so much for a casual game about the animal kingdom.

Here are some early attempts to give you an idea of what I mean:

**Attempt 1**

_Pretty, but it felt more suited to meditation than to a lighthearted game._

<audio controls src="/audio/circle_of_life_attempt_1.mp3" />

**Attempt 2**

_More upbeat and playful, which was an improvement, but still didnâ€™t fully capture the gameâ€™s bright and fun art style._

<audio controls src="/audio/circle_of_life_attempt_2.mp3" />

**Attempt 3**

_This is what we used in the finished game. Iâ€™m happy with how it sits in the overall experience._

<audio controls src="/audio/circle_of_life_attempt_3.mp3" />

Looking back, this process could have been much faster if I had wrote a clearer brief with more defined examples of similar music. I had started with a brief, but I didnâ€™t test it enough against the game vision, or get enough feedback from the team early on.

## 2. Layering

One of the most interesting parts of composing for games compared to film or other media is that games are **non-linear**. Players are constantly taking actions, and the game reacts in real time.

Iâ€™ve always liked games that use dynamically layered music, but this was my first time attempting it myself. My biggest learning here is to **write vertically**: group instruments into layers that can be added or removed independently, so the music can adapt seamlessly as gameplay changes.

I was able to implement this in a small way: during the shop scene, a pared-back arrangement plays; during the loop, the full ensemble comes in. I wish Iâ€™d had more time to expand on this idea, but I was proud of the effect.

## 3. SFX is a hard job

Creating sounds that can effectively communicate what is happening, without becoming irritating after the 50th time they play, is not easy.

Our game featured a lot of animal noises, and these were especially tricky because theyâ€™re so distinct. I ended up relying heavily on [freesound.org](https://freesound.org/) for many of the SFX, using Logic Pro to tweak them with pitch shifting, time stretching, and other small adjustments.

Next time, Iâ€™d make sure to allow more time for this part of the process.

## Final thoughts

Iâ€™m proud of what I was able to do in just 72 hours. The most valuable thing I gained was confidence, both in my ability to adapt my musical style to a completely different context, and in my ability to collaborate quickly with strangers.

Iâ€™ll definitely be back for another game jam in the near future. [Brackeys 2025.2](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-14) is just around the corner, after all ðŸ˜€
