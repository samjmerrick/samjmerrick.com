This is my music composer portfolio website.

I cloned the [Vercel next.js porfolio template](https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/solutions/blog), added some goodies such as [@wavesurver/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wavesurfer/react), and generally played with the site structure until I was happy with it.
